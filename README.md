## About the project

This project defines two classes: TupleDictionary and SimpleXMLElementToArray to make it easier to compare PHP arrays
and XML fragments.

### Motivation

This project is standalone but is part of the XBRL project.  

The XBRL project needs the ability to determine if two arrays representsing a collection of key/value pairs are identical and 
hold data against those pairs.  This is achieved using the TupleDictionary class.  

It also sometimes necessary, for example when examining segment or scenarios within contexts in instance documents, to
be able to compare for equality the elements defined under segments or scenarios of a pair of contexts.  The 
SimpleXMLElementToArray class makes it simple to convert the elements defined under a segment or scenario element node
to an array so they can be compared following the various rules defined by the XBRL 2.1 specification.  

It is common to need to create a temporary file to hold zip contents and then tidy up after.  The MemoryWrapper is a StreamWrapper
implementation that provides a named in-memory pseudo file that can be uses to store content.  The 'filename' can then be passed
to another function such as file_get_contents() so the contents can be accessed.  The pseudo file will be lost when the script
terminates so there is no need to explcitly delete the file.  However the file can be explicitly deleted to recover memory. 

### Dependencies

This project depends on [pear/log](https://github.com/pear/Log) and [lyquidity/xml](https://github.com/bseddon/xml)

## License

This project is released under [GPL version 3.0](LICENCE)

**What does this mean?**

It means you can use the source code in any way you see fit.  However, the source code for any changes you make must be made available to others and must be made
available on the same terms as you receive the source code in this project: under a GPL v3.0 license.  You must include the license of this project with any
distribution of the source code whether the distribution includes all the source code or just part of it.  For example, if you create a class that derives 
from one of the classes provided by this project - a new taxonomy class, perhaps - that is derivative.

**What does this not mean?**

It does *not* mean that any products you create that only *use* this source code must be released under GPL v3.0.  If you create a budgeting application that uses
the source code from this project to access data in instance documents, used by the budgeting application to transfer data, that is not derivative.

## Install

The project can be installed by [composer](https://getcomposer.org/).   Assuming Composer is installed and a shortcut to the program is called 'composer'
then the command to install this project is:

```
composer require lyquidity/utilities:dev-master lyquidity/xml:dev-master --prefer-dist
```


Or fork or download the repository.  The source can be found in the 'source' sub-folder.

## Getting started

The test.php file includes illustrations of using the classes.

Assuming you have installed the library using composer then this PHP application will run the test:

```php
&lt;?php
require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';
include __DIR__ . "/vendor/lyquidity/utilities/test.php";
```
